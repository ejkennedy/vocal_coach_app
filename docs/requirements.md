# AI Vocal Coach Flutter Application Requirements

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for the AI Vocal Coach Flutter application. The application aims to provide users with professional vocal feedback by analyzing their singing performances and offering constructive criticism and encouragement.

## Core Features

### User Vocal Recording Upload and Categorization

The application will allow users to upload MP3 files containing their vocal performances. Upon upload, users will be presented with two categorization options:

1. **Original Composition**: For performances of songs written by the user themselves
2. **Cover Performance**: For performances of existing songs by other artists

This categorization is crucial as it determines the subsequent analysis flow and feedback generation process.

### YouTube to MP3 Conversion for Reference Tracks

When a user categorizes their upload as a cover performance, the application will:

1. Prompt the user to provide a YouTube URL of the original song
2. Extract and download the audio from the provided YouTube video
3. Convert the downloaded audio to MP3 format
4. Store this reference track for comparison purposes

This feature eliminates the need for users to manually find and download reference tracks, streamlining the comparison process.

### AI Vocal Analysis and Feedback Generation

The core functionality of the application is its AI-powered analysis system that will:

1. Process the user's vocal recording
2. For covers: Compare the user's performance against the reference track
3. Analyze various vocal aspects including:
   - Pitch accuracy
   - Timing and rhythm
   - Breath control and support
   - Vocal tone and timbre
   - Dynamic range
   - Articulation and pronunciation
   - Emotional expression

4. Generate detailed feedback that includes:
   - Specific areas of strength (e.g., "Good breath support for that long note")
   - Areas for improvement (e.g., "The high G was flat")
   - Technical suggestions (e.g., "Try use darker vowel sounds for this phrase")
   - Overall performance assessment

### Timeline-Based Feedback Display

The application will present feedback in an interactive timeline format where:

1. The user's audio waveform is displayed as a visual timeline
2. Feedback markers are placed at specific timestamps corresponding to the relevant sections of the performance
3. Users can tap on markers to view detailed feedback for that specific moment
4. Users can play back their recording and see feedback appear in real-time as the playback progresses
5. The timeline should be navigable, allowing users to jump to specific feedback points

## User Interface Requirements

### Modern and Simple Design Principles

The UI design should adhere to the following principles:

1. **Clean and Minimalist**: Avoid cluttered interfaces and unnecessary elements
2. **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should be able to understand how to use the app without extensive tutorials
3. **Consistent Visual Language**: Maintain consistency in colors, typography, and interactive elements
4. **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the app functions well on various screen sizes and orientations
5. **Accessibility**: Implement proper contrast, text scaling, and screen reader support

### Key UI Components

1. **Home Screen**:
   - Clear options for uploading a new recording or accessing previous analyses
   - Recent analyses preview section
   - Quick access to app settings

2. **Upload and Categorization Screen**:
   - File selection interface
   - Clear categorization options (Original vs. Cover)
   - For covers: YouTube URL input field with validation
   - Processing status indicators

3. **Analysis Timeline Screen**:
   - Audio waveform visualization
   - Playback controls (play, pause, seek)
   - Feedback markers on the timeline
   - Feedback detail panel that updates based on timeline position or marker selection
   - Options to save, share, or export the analysis

4. **Settings and Profile Screen**:
   - User preferences
   - Analysis history
   - Account management (if applicable)

## Technical Requirements

### Flutter Implementation

The application will be developed using the Flutter framework to ensure:

1. Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)
2. Smooth animations and transitions
3. Consistent UI rendering across devices
4. Efficient development workflow

### Audio Processing Capabilities

The application must implement:

1. MP3 file handling and processing
2. Audio waveform visualization
3. Audio playback with precise timestamp tracking
4. YouTube video downloading and audio extraction

### AI Analysis Integration

The application will need to:

1. Implement or integrate an AI system capable of vocal analysis
2. Process audio files to extract vocal characteristics
3. Compare reference and performance tracks for covers
4. Generate meaningful, constructive feedback
5. Map feedback to specific timestamps in the audio

### Data Management

The application should:

1. Store user recordings securely
2. Manage reference tracks efficiently
3. Save analysis results for future reference
4. Implement appropriate caching strategies for performance optimization

## User Experience Considerations

### Performance Analysis Flow

1. User uploads their vocal recording
2. User categorizes the recording (Original or Cover)
3. If Cover: User provides YouTube URL of original song
4. Application processes the audio and performs analysis
5. User is presented with the timeline view containing feedback markers
6. User can interact with the timeline, play their recording, and view feedback

### Feedback Presentation

Feedback should be:

1. **Constructive**: Focus on how to improve rather than just pointing out flaws
2. **Specific**: Tied to exact moments in the performance
3. **Balanced**: Include both positive reinforcement and areas for improvement
4. **Technical yet Accessible**: Use proper musical terminology but explain concepts when necessary
5. **Actionable**: Provide clear suggestions that users can implement

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

While not part of the initial requirements, the following features could be considered for future versions:

1. **Social Sharing**: Allow users to share their performances and feedback
2. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor improvement over time across multiple recordings
3. **Guided Exercises**: Provide vocal exercises targeted at improving specific areas
4. **Community Features**: Enable users to give feedback to each other
5. **Premium Analysis Options**: Offer more detailed analysis for subscription users

## Conclusion

This AI Vocal Coach Flutter application aims to provide singers with accessible, detailed, and constructive feedback on their performances. By combining modern mobile technology with AI-powered vocal analysis, the application will serve as a valuable tool for singers looking to improve their skills, whether they're performing original compositions or covering existing songs.

The modern, simple UI design will ensure that users can focus on their vocal development without being distracted or confused by the application interface. The timeline-based feedback system will make it easy for users to understand exactly where and how they can improve their performances.
